# SL inky

SL inky is a small Python script that aims to let people have small signs
for the next bus/metro/ferry/tram/train departure in the Stockholm area
(and hopefully eventually extending to all of Sweden) based on Pimoroni's
Inky eink displays.

## Usage

You'll need a (free) API key for "SL Realtidsinformation 4" from
[Trafiklab](https://www.trafiklab.se/api/trafiklab-apis/sl/departures-4/).

Until there is some user ergonomics in place, you'll have to start by updating
`bus.py` manually to your preference.
